This plugin provides the ability to configure post-specific permissions.

== Description ==

User Permissions is a plugin that takes the simple WordPress permissions models one step further and allows you to assign permissions to specific posts that restrict users or roles from reading or editing it.

To summarize:

* Restrict reading or writing of post or page according to the user's role (i.e. prevent non-registered users reading a post)
* Allow specific users to read or write a post or page
* Permissions are assigned directly inside the post itself - there is no additional interface
* Fully localized

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download `user-permissions.zip`
1. Unzip
1. Upload `user-permissions` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin
